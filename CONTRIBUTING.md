Packages imported via the Unity Package Manager can not be edited by default.

If you like to use this package and be able to edit and contribute to this repo you, can clone it inside the Packages folder (next to your Unity project Assets folder). Unity will then treat it as custom package that will be visible in the Package Manager, but can be edited.

If you already use Git for your main Unity project, you can add this project as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules):
Browse to the Unity Packages folder in your git terminal, and add this repo as a git module with the following command:

`git submodule add https://github.com/Amsterdam/Netherlands3D`

This way you can pull changes, or make contributions to the Netherlands 3D project while keeping it separate from your project.
