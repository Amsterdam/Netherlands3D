# Showing Windmills

## Installation

This package is included in the [Amsterdam/Netherlands3D](https://github.com/Amsterdam/Netherlands3D) package and once 
that is installed, you have access to this as well.

Before making use of this package, make sure a TileHandler is set up, see the ExampleMunicipality package or the 
TileHandler sample how to do that.

> The ExampleMunicipality package has Windmills set up; you can observe the WindmillLayer prefab as a child of the 
> `Features/TileHandler` game object.

## Usage

Drag the `WindmillLayer` prefab into your project -recommended is to add it as a child to your TileHandler
GameObject-. That should be all.

With this Prefab in place, you can start your scene and navigate to a location where a Windmill is located; and
an animated model will be located there.
